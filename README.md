# bad-nes

An NES emulator written in TypeScript. Merely as an exercise.

## Questions

*Q: Why is it implemented in TypeScript and not in an actual programming language?*<br>
A: I'm not really interested in venturing out of my comfort zone. I've wanted to make an emulator for years and writing it in a language I don't use every single day will make it decades.

Also, I guess it would actually be easier to use a language that has adequate integers and not whatever the fuck JS does. Can we consider it a challenge?

*Q: Why is it so limited?*<br>
A: fuck you

## Usage

# bad-nes

An NES emulator written in TypeScript.

## Questions

*Q: Why is it implemented in TypeScript and not in an actual programming language?*<br>
A: I'm not really interested in venturing out of my comfort zone. I've wanted to make an emulator for years and writing it in a language I don't use every single day will make it decades.

*Q: Why is it so limited?*<br>
A: fuck you

## Usage
